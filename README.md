🏦 Banking Domain – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

Technologies: Python | MySQL | Power BI | Excel

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on Banking Risk Analytics, aiming to analyze customer data to understand and minimize financial risks associated with lending. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, integrating Python, MySQL, and Power BI to clean, store, analyze, and visualize data efficiently.

The final result is an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into customer loans, deposits, and risk patterns—helping banks make informed and data-driven decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer demographics and financial behavior.

Identify risk patterns related to loans and deposits.

Build a structured pipeline for data cleaning, storage, and visualization.

Develop a professional dashboard for banking risk analysis.

🧩 Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation

The project begins with a banking dataset stored in Excel format, containing information such as customer age, gender, occupation, income, deposits, and loans.
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed in Python (Jupyter / Google Colab) by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting columns.
The cleaned data was then saved as a CSV file for further processing.

2. Database Setup

A new database named banking_case was created in MySQL to store the cleaned data.
The data was imported into a table named customer, allowing structured queries and easy integration with visualization tools.
SQL queries were used for validation, aggregation, and relationship analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed in Python to understand customer behavior and financial patterns.
This included:

Univariate analysis: understanding individual variables like income or credit card ownership.

Bivariate analysis: comparing two variables such as loan amount by gender or occupation.

Correlation analysis: identifying relationships between numerical features such as deposits, savings, and loans.

4. Dashboard Creation

The processed data from MySQL was connected directly to Power BI Desktop to create an interactive dashboard.

Dashboard features include:

Multiple pages such as Homepage, Loan Analysis, and Deposit Analysis.

KPI cards displaying key metrics like Total Loan and Total Deposit.

Visuals like bar charts and donut charts for loan and deposit segmentation.

Slicers to filter data by gender, income band, and joining year.

Page navigation buttons for smooth user interaction.

The dashboard provides a clear and interactive way to explore banking data, revealing patterns that help identify financial risk areas.

📊 Key Insights

Customers with higher income levels tend to have higher deposits and lower loan risks.

A strong positive correlation exists between deposits, savings, and checking accounts.

Certain occupations and nationalities are associated with higher business lending.

The dashboard enables real-time filtering to reveal customer and product insights effectively.

🧠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Jupyter / Google Colab) – Data cleaning, analysis, and EDA

MySQL (Workbench) – Data storage and management

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard creation and visualization

Microsoft Excel – Raw dataset preparation and validation

🚀 Outcome

This project successfully delivers a complete, data-driven banking analytics solution that:

Monitors loan and deposit trends.

Identifies customer risk patterns.

Supports strategic decision-making through data visualization.

The end product is a professional Power BI dashboard integrated with a live MySQL database, making it a strong portfolio project for data analytics professionals.
